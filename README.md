# Comparing gradient descent methods
The efficiency of different gradient descent methods is tested for the phase retrieval problem in complex space. The three methods used are classic Gradient Descent (GD), Stochastic GD (SGD) and persistent SGD (p-SGD).
Parameters can be varied in the .py file, shell files are included to run on EPFL's JED cluster, for both the simulation run (creating pickled data) and the plotting of the average magnetization and loss.
